3. `loop3.wav` (approx. 23.2s)
4. `loop4.wav` (approx. 28.0s)
5. `loop5.wav` (approx. 29.5s)
6. `loop6.wav` (approx. 30.0s)
7. `loop7.wav` (approx. 31.1s)
8. `loop8.wav` (approx. 38.0s)

**Technical Requirements:**
- **Format:** `.wav` (PCM)
- **Sample Rate:** 44.1kHz or 48kHz preferred
- **Naming:** Must be lowercase and match the list above exactly.
